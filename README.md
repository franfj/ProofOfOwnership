#### Context
Two files are uploaded to the server (an original doc and an original pdf).

#### Program parameters
1. Path to file
2. File hash (real or deceiving one)

#### Possible outputs
- If an original file is upload along with its real hasg, the server will return the file (its hash will be shown) after going through PoW protocol.
- If an original file is uploaded along a wrong/deceiving hash, the server will upload the file (if it exists, the file will be uploaded, if not, the server won't do anything).
- If a manipulated file is uploaded along with a wrong hash, the server will upload the file (it will calculate the manipulated file hash).
- If a manipulated file is uploaded along with its hash, the server will upload the file.
